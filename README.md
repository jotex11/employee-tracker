## Description
This application is supposed to be able to keep employees names, jobs, and salarys in a database, and the user is supposed to be able to add an employee and see how much they make for their jobs. 
## Task
My task was to create a application that asks a user questions about an employee and show them peoples names, salary and job. I was also tasked to add a feature that would allow the user to add an employee to the database. 

## Installation
1. Clone github repo.
2. Open on vscode.
3. Open terminal and type <code>npm install</code> then <code>npm instal</code> so you get package.json, and finally type <code>npm init -y</code> so you can have correct files needed.
4. In terminal type <code>node server.js</code> and answer questions asked.

## Credits 
I had to use Stack Overflow to answer some of my questions and find solutions to some of my problems. I was still not able to get anything figured out for this challenge.
